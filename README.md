## Concepts:
### Clean Architecture
If you must build a software with scalability you must have clean architecture.
This is the main-set for do a good software and not do a mess.

For learn how to build with a clean architecture .I recommend you the book of Robert. C. Martin. Clean Architecture.Read This Book First of all.  

But if you are lazy you can view the youtube Videos of the Uncle Bob:

### Clean Code
For learn how to write a clean code I recommended the books:
Andy Hunt y Dave Thomas. The pragmatic programmer.
Robert. C. Martin. Clean Code.

### Design Patterns
For learn how to write With Design Patterns I recommended the books:
Design Patterns. Eric. Evans 

### Algile Manifesto and DevSecOps Manifesto
if you don't understand these principles please read first Clean Architecture of Robert C. Martin

### DevSecOps
For understand what is DevSecOps you need understand what is DevOps:

Check if you are agile

### GitFlow or Trunk Based Development
In my opinion for started Teams i recommend the use of GitFlow
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow
For agile and experimented Teams Trunk Based Development
